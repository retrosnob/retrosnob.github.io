<h2 id="downloading-thonny">Downloading Thonny</h2>
<p>I recommend that you use Thonny as your Python editor because it has the Python interpreter built in. It can be downloaded from <a href="https://thonny.org">https://thonny.org</a> and it perfectly good for GCSE and A-Level.</p>
<h2 id="the-thonny-interface">The Thonny interface</h2>
<p>When you open Thonny you will see two panes.</p>
<p>The upper pane is a text editor that allows you to edit Python files. Write whole programs in here and press the green play button to execute. (You will need to have saved the file somewhere first.)</p>
<p>The bottom pane is the shell. Here you can execute single lines of Python in an interactive REPL mode. When you write a line of code and execute it, Python will evaluate it and print the result. If the line of code doesn’t evaluate to anything, nothing will be printed.</p>

<p><strong>Thonny tips:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If your program hangs, use the red Stop button to halt it.</li>
<li>You can clear the shell by right-clicking on it and choosing Clear.</li>
<li>Thonny has an “assistant” that warns you of various things. I find it annoying. You can disable it in Tools, Options, Assistant…</li>
<li>Python has a debugger built in. In my opinion, the default setting of <em>Nicer</em> is too verbose. You can change it to <em>Faster</em> in Tools, Options, Run &amp; Debug…</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="variables-and-data-types">Variables and data types</h1>
<h2 id="variables">Variables</h2>
<p>We can store items of data for use in computer programs. These stored items are called variables. We refer to variables using names.</p>
<pre class=" language-python"><code class="prism  language-python"><span class="token comment"># Store the value 5 in a variable called x</span>
x <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token number">5</span>

<span class="token comment"># Store the value "Fred" in a variable called name</span>
name <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token string">"Fred"</span>
</code></pre>
<h3 id="variable-names">Variable names</h3>
<p>Variable names can include letters, numbers and the underscore (_) character, but they cannot begin with numbers.</p>
<p>You should try to choose variable names that make it easy to tell meaning of the data held in the variable.</p>
<h4 id="naming-conflicts">Naming conflicts</h4>
<p>Some names in Python already mean something and you should therefore not use them as variable names.</p>
<p>Some examples of names you should <strong>not</strong> use for variables are:</p>
<p>sum, max, min, int, float, bool, str, string, random, list, type, dir</p>
<p>Single-letter names are generally not a good idea but sometimes they’re ok. For instance:</p>
<ul>
<li>i, j, k are often used as simple counter integers (integer means whole number)</li>
<li>x, y, z are often used for coordinates</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="data-types">Data types</h2>
<p>Variables stored data and data can be of different types. The GCSE focuses on the following data types:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Whole numbers (integers)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Numbers with decimal points (floats)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sequences of text characters (strings)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>True/False variables (booleans)</p>
</li>
</ul>
