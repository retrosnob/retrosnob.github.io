# Variables and data types

## Variables

We can store items of data for use in computer programs. These stored items are called variables. We refer to variables using names.

``` Python
# Store the value 5 in a variable called x
x = 5
``` 

## Data types

Whole numbers (integers)

Numbers with decimal points (floats)

Sequences of text characters (strings)

True/False variables (booleans)
