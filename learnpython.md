# Variables and data types

## Variables

We can store items of data for use in computer programs. These stored items are called variables. We refer to variables using names.

``` Python
# Store the value 5 in a variable called x
x = 5

# Store the value "Fred" in a variable called name
name = "Fred"

### Variable names

Variable names can include letters, numbers and the underscore (_) character, but they cannot begin with numbers.

You should try to choose variable names that make it easy to tell meaning of the data held in the variable. 

#### Naming conflicts

Some names in Python already mean something and you should therefore not use them as variable names. 

Some examples of names you should not use for variables are:

sum, max, min, int, float, bool, str, string, random, list, type, dir

Single-letter names are generally not a good idea but sometimes they're ok. For instance:

* i, j, k are often used as simple counter integers
* x, y, z are often used for coordinates
``` 

## Data types

Variables stored data and data can be of different types. The GCSE focuses on the following data types:

* Whole numbers (integers)

* Numbers with decimal points (floats)

* Sequences of text characters (strings)

* True/False variables (booleans)

# Grouping lots a variables together with lists

# Selecting which lines of code to execute with If statements

# Looping: repeating a block of code once for every item in a collection (for loops)

# Looping: repeating a block of code as long as a condition is true (while loops)

# Functions: named blocks of code that do a job and return a result

# Working with files

This is normal text. 

This is *italic*.

This is **bold**.

This is ~strikethrough~.

This is <span style="color: red">red</span>. This doesn't work. 

```python
for word in words:
    print(len(word))
